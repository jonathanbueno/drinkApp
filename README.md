# drinkApp

App made with React Native to learn how to develop with this technology.

# Installation

```bash
yarn install
```

# Run the App

For now, the app is only running in Development mode (Expo).

If you want to test this app on your phone, you need to install the app "Expo go" (Android or iOS).

If you want just to check out the web version, run the following code on your project folder:

```bash
yarn web
```

- P.s: For the web version, resize your window to a mobile size and then refresh it ;)
